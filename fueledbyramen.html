        <h2> A Brief Introduction on Fueled By Ramen </h2>
        <p> Fueled by Ramen is an American record label, which is currently owned by Warner Music Group. The label was founded in Gainesville, Florida in the year 1996 by John Janick. Janick thought of starting a record label while he attended high school. He started the label while he was attending the University of Florida. He teamed up with Vinne Florello, the drummer from the band Less Than Jake, to make his record label dreams a reality. <br> <br> The name of the band was inspirted by Florello and Janick's experinece in only affording cheap meals such as ramen during hte beginning of the growth of the record label. Both Florello and Janick invested the majority of their money into the label, which left them will little to no money for affordable food. Although, the label was founded in Florida, it is now based out of New York.The New York office doors were opened in 2007. The same year that Paramore's<i>Riot!</i>album was released. The label prides its self for being more than just a label. They consider themselves a brand than a record label. They are a brand that embraces the community of punk inspired and rock/pop bands. To many fans of FBR bands, FBR is a lifestyle.
