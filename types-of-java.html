     <h1> Types of JavaScript</h1> 
      <p> JavaScript is the true programming language and it is also an interpreted language. It allows you to create new behaviors, behaviors that allow you to give your page some life. It dynamically typed as well as object oriented. JavaScript can seem very difficult. It is one of the most complicated but doable coding languages. To get the hang of JavaScript you must know the basics. Knowing the primitive types of JavaScript is important. It is important to know what they are and how they work. The five types of JavaScript are boolean, null, undefined, number, and string.</p>
      <ol> 
          <li> <h1>Boolean </h1> <br> <p> Boolean is a logical data type that can only have the values of true or false. It allows you to represent true and false. With out boolean and its value, if statements would not be doable in JavaScript. Using boolean allows you to find out if an expression or variable is true or false. </p></li>
          <li> <h1>Null </h1><br> <p> Null is a representation of intentional absence of any object value. Null expresses a lack of identification. It indicates that a variable points to no object. There is a difference between null and undefined. You have to beware of the differences in equality (equal sign). Null is an object type.</p> </li>
          <li> <h1>Undefined </h1> <br> <p> Undefined is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to variables. The variable has been declared but not yet been assigned a value. Undefined is a type itself. Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined.</p></li>
          <li> <h1> Number</h1><br><p>Numbers in JavaScript is very trivial. Integers and floating-point numbers are under the number type umbrella in JavaScript. JavaScript does not define different types or numbers. For example it does not define them as short, long, floating-point, integer, or etc. Integers are considered accurate up to 15 digits. The maximum decimal is 17. Floating-point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate. With these numbers you can always add, subtract, divide, and multiply. In JavaScript you should NEVER write them with a leading zero. 

 </p></li>
          <li> <h1>String </h1> <br><p> Strings are a sequence of characters. Strings are created with characters such as letters, numbers, punctuations and etc. They are enclosed in between a pair of single or double quotations. It doesnâ€™t matter whether or not you use single or double quotations. Single and double quotations are identical; it is up to you to use either. When you pick one to use, you will have to be consistent. To use double quotes inside a string you could surround the entire string in single quotes. If you want to use single quotes in a string you can surround the string in double quotes. 
It can also be done by using a backward slash before any type of quote mark that appears within a string. This technique is called escaping.
</p> </li>
        </ol>
      <p> Now that you, the reader, has learned about the types in JavaScript you can finally learn JavaScript with ease. These types are like the learning blocks of JavaScript. They allow you to understand how JavaScript works and how each component of it works. </p>
