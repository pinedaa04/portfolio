    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is Ashley Pineda. I am a recent Seattle Pacific University graduate learning how to code. I have always wanted to learn how to code so I'm excited for my class.<br><br> I enjoy going to concerts and taking photographs. I believe that there is beauty in everything and taking photos helps you capture that beauty. You can always find me listening to music and taking photos with my DSLR or with my phone. </p>
